## Abstract

At Studio Syro, we create animated stories entirely within virtual reality. Using **Quill**, a VR-native painting and animation tool, we draw, animate, and build worlds directly inside the headset. Our first project, **Tales from Soda Island**, was the first animated series made completely in VR, and it laid the groundwork for an expressive, handcrafted production pipeline that we've used for every project since.

We've since expanded this approach across mediums and formats, creating and publishing animated pieces like **Nyssa**, **The Art of Change**, and various music videos and stage visuals, as well as interactive experiences like our SXVA prototype, **PondQuest**, and **Dear Metaverse**.

In this talk, we walk through the way we work, how we build and animate in VR, prototype in Unity, and keep our tools lightweight and artist-friendly. From quick sketches to spatial storytelling, we share what it takes to build entire worlds with small teams and big ideas.

## Key Topics

### VR-Native Production Pipeline
- **Quill as Primary Tool**: Hand-painting and animating directly in VR
- **Spatial Storytelling**: Creating narratives designed for immersive experiences
- **Artist-Friendly Workflow**: Keeping tools lightweight and accessible

### Projects Discussed
1. **Tales from Soda Island** - First animated series made completely in VR
2. **Nyssa (Reimagined Volume I)** - VR animated short film
3. **The Art of Change** - Immersive music experience
4. **PondQuest** - Interactive VR experience
5. **Dear Metaverse** - Interactive narrative experience
6. Music videos and stage visuals

### Technical Approach
- **VR Creation**: Drawing and animating inside the headset
- **Unity Prototyping**: Rapid prototyping for interactive experiences
- **Small Team Methodology**: Building entire worlds with limited resources
- **Handcrafted Aesthetic**: Maintaining artistic expression in VR

## Significance

This paper represents the first comprehensive documentation of Studio Syro's pioneering VR production pipeline. As creators of the first fully VR-animated series, we share insights into:

- How to build sustainable VR animation workflows
- Balancing artistic vision with technical constraints
- Scaling handcrafted VR production
- Transitioning between linear and interactive VR experiences

## Context: SIGGRAPH Spatial Storytelling

The Spatial Storytelling track at SIGGRAPH 2025 brought together creators, researchers, and technologists exploring new forms of immersive narrative. Our presentation joined a diverse program featuring:

- Mixed reality theater and performance
- AI-driven spatial audio
- Virtual puppetry and motion capture
- Interactive XR installations
- Aquatic VR experiences
