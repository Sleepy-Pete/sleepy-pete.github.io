## My Role

As Creative Producer, I:

- Manage production timelines and deliverables
- Guide creative direction while maintaining technical feasibility
- Build and maintain relationships with platform partners like Meta/Oculus

## The Journey

Studio Syro began with a music video project that brought together talented VR artists who had never worked together before. This collaboration proved so successful that it evolved into a full studio, eventually catching the attention of Oculus, who approached us to create a series for their Quest platform.

Over three years, we've grown from a small team working on a single music video to a recognized studio in the VR animation space, with our work featured at prestigious festivals and conferences worldwide.
