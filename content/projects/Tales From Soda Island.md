# Tales From Soda Island

![Tales From Soda Island Banner](/static/images/tfsi/soda%20banner.jpg)

## Overview

"Tales From Soda Island" will send you on an immersive journey through the vibrant and complex musical ecosystem of Soda Island. You'll discover strange creatures, ancient rituals, and cosmic symphonies working together in harmony to produce a story unlike anything you've ever seen before!

This VR animated series is an anthology of events that unfold on Soda Island. Each story is unique and follows diverse themes with a central narrative woven throughout the series. "Tales From Soda Island" was created entirely in VR using Quill by Smoothstep over three years. The series and its content are over two hours long and have millions of views on the MetaQuest Platform.

## Watch on Meta Quest

I encourage you to watch the series for yourself on MetaQuest - it is like nothing you have ever seen, and a 2D format really does not do it justice. Here are links to:

## Achievement

This is one of the most significant projects I have ever had the honor of participating in. The world of Soda Island is truly a wonderful experience. I often call it a "virtual hug." I promise you will feel better after immersing yourself in this playful and thrilling world. We had an exceptional team working on this project under the creative leadership of Simone Fournier.

Thank you to Goro Fujita and Ryan Genji Thomas, who recognized our passion for using Quill and gave us the opportunity to create content for their platform. We seized the opportunity and created some of the most innovative and creative additions to the expanding world of VR.

The Venice Film Festival and Siggraph have recognized the series.

## My Role

At Studio Syro, I led complete project oversight, fostering collaboration across all production levels, from executive producers, directors, artists, animators, audio directors, and sound designers. I guided initial pitches and collaborated with the director through every production stage. I managed the early ideation phases, scriptwriting, storyboarding, development of animatics, and rough cuts leading up to the alpha and final release stages.

Leveraging my creative and technical background, I contributed to storytelling and tackled challenges for 3D implementation. Overseeing task management, managing deadlines, and handling all forms of communication with key stakeholders for our production were crucial components that defined my multifaceted role at Studio Syro.

Building and hiring the right team was essential, as was overseeing budgeting, payroll, and legal review processes. I was the primary individual for spatial audio work for each experience and IT support throughout production. I also spent R&D time on technical improvements to our pipeline and software. Simultaneously, I handled various studio obligations related to running a business.
