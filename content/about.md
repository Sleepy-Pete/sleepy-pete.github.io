## Full Bio

With over five years of production experience, I have leveraged my expertise in creative storytelling and technical skills to create captivating VR experiences at Studio Syro. As **Co-Founder** of the studio and **Creative Producer**, I have helped steer our talented artists and developers towards the successful creation of **"Tales From Soda Island,"** a VR animated series. My leadership approach fosters a collaborative and innovative culture, encouraging the team to consistently push the boundaries of entertainment in the VR space.

My career began with a technical artist internship at Perilous Orbit, working on their "Social Club VR" project. This experience ignited a passion for graphics, so I continued to study and learn all I could in this space to develop my skills. While I focused on various creative projects, I expanded my business development and IT infrastructure knowledge at e-TechServices as a Technical Sales Manager. Not long after, my career took an exciting turn at KWEST, an AR startup looking to expand on location-based games. I initially worked as a Technical Artist, navigating mobile development limitations, and later stepped up as the Producer for the team.

The start of Studio Syro marks a significant milestone in my career. One summer, I was approached by a close friend who was debating taking on a music video project. We reviewed the pros and cons and considered everything — the story, the visuals, the potential uses for real-time engines — and finally decided to do it. We assembled a team of talented VR artists and developed one of the earliest use cases for VR as a primary production tool.

As the Producer of this project, I focused on coordinating the efforts between individuals who had never worked together. We created an incredible music video for the artist. More importantly, we formed a team of some of the most talented VR artists and animators. This was the beginning of Studio Syro.

After creating that video, Oculus approached us with an opportunity to create a series for their Quest headsets utilizing the VR painting tool Quill. As a team, we developed "Tales From Soda Island" based on some existing work created by our Creative Director, Simone Fougnier (AKA Funilabs).

Over the next three years, I managed this studio alongside our dedicated team. We continued to expand on the series and to develop a variety of projects. I found myself immersing in the full scope of what it takes to manage this unique company.

Productions, whether in entertainment or software, require the collaboration of creative and technical minds. That synergy is where the innovation stems from. My role has been cultivating an environment where teams can perform at their best. The collective efforts and time spent together are as important as the end goal.
