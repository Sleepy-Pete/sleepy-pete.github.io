## Short Bio

I am Peter Ariet, a Creative Producer and technical artist, and Co-Founder of Studio Syro. I lead end-to-end XR productions across VR, AR, and location based experiences, bridging storytelling, team leadership, and hands on technical problem solving. My work includes the Meta published VR animated series Tales From Soda Island and the immersive album experience The Art of Change, with projects showcased at Venice, SXSW, and SIGGRAPH.

## Full Bio

I am a producer and technical artist based in San Diego, operating at the intersection of storytelling and emerging technology. I co-founded Studio Syro to build immersive worlds where hand crafted art direction and real time production can live together, and I specialize in aligning creative teams, technical constraints, and partner expectations to ship audience ready experiences.

At Studio Syro, I lead production across the full lifecycle, including scoping, budgeting, scheduling, resourcing, risk management, and delivery. I also contribute as a technical artist, with a focus on shader development and optimization for headset class hardware, Quill to engine workflows, and performance planning (frame time, draw calls, memory, lighting, VFX). Across studio projects, I have supported source control and production tooling (GitHub and Perforce collaboration workflows) and helped build reliable pipelines for artists and developers working in Unity and Unreal.

My studio credits include Tales From Soda Island (sponsored and published by Meta) and Reimagined Vol. I: Nyssa, plus a range of commercial and music driven work. Tales From Soda Island includes:

- Chapter 1: The Multiverse Bakery
- Chapter 2: The Neon Jungle (SIGGRAPH 2021 VR Theater)
- Chapter 3: The Quantum Race
- Chapter 4: The Golden Record
- Chapter 5: The School Trip
- Chapter 6: Silence (Webby Awards nominee)
- Chapter 7: The First Ingredient (80th Venice International Film Festival)

I also produced and supported The Art of Change (81st Venice International Film Festival), directed by Simone Fougnier (Funilab) and Vincent Rooijers (Droeloe), and worked on Reimagined Vol. I: Nyssa (79th Venice International Film Festival), directed by Julie Cavaliere. Additional credits include development and technical production across a vertical slice for Flipside (unreleased), commercial work with Level99 and Area23 (unreleased), and live visuals for artists including Bad Bunny and Mr. Bill, plus the music video Dreaming of You / Far Away for Slushii.

More recently, I served as Lead Producer at WEVR for the large scale location based VR experience Emperor: Dust-Covered Empire (Terracotta Warriors: Secrets of the First Emperor's Mausoleum), in partnership with HTC VIVE Arts and China based stakeholders. I guided delivery from greybox to beta and deployment planning, built production systems (SOWs, addenda, milestones, invoicing, vendor coordination), and ran zone based QA tracking (Z01 to Z16) to keep fixes, defers, and acceptance criteria aligned across multiple teams. I also helped coordinate narrative, dialogue review, and VO timing passes and approvals, while managing historically sensitive review cycles and documentation for culturally significant content. On the technical side, I collaborated within Unreal Engine pipelines and worked with engineering to navigate Perforce constraints and make pragmatic performance decisions and content cuts for headset class limits.

Alongside shipped work, I prototype and build toward new interactive products. Recent initiatives include early production leadership for PondQuest (mixed reality gameplay) and Dear Metaverse (a hand tracking MR messaging experience), defining scope, KPIs, and vertical slice deliverables.

Before Studio Syro, I worked at the AR startup KWEST as a Technical Artist and later as Producer, leading creative and technical development for platform features and narrative driven AR experiences playable anywhere. Earlier roles include Technical Sales Engineer at e-TechServices, where I designed and supported customized server solutions and infrastructure planning, and Technical Artist Intern at Perilous Orbit, where I gained hands on experience with Unreal Engine 4, shader networks, visual scripting, and C++ while researching technical art best practices for VR tool design. I also worked at the University of Florida Digital Worlds Institute as an AV Technician and Student Assistant, supporting classroom operations, live streams, lecture capture, and building wide technical support.

I care deeply about the synergy between creative and technical disciplines, because that is where the strongest work happens. My job is to keep vision, process, and execution aligned so teams can do their best work and ship with confidence.
