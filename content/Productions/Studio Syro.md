**Co-Founder & Creative Producer** | 2020 - Present

## Overview

Studio Syro is an independent creative studio specializing in immersive storytelling, VR animation, and mixed reality experiences. As Co-Founder and Creative Producer, I've helped lead our international team in crafting rich, interactive worlds using innovative tools like Quill and real-time engines.

Our work blends artistry and technology to create experiences that transport audiences into new dimensions—whether in virtual reality, mixed reality, or beyond. With a passion for cinematic storytelling and cutting-edge production, we push the boundaries of spatial storytelling.

## Our Creative Tool: Quill

All of our animated experiences are created using **[[Quill]]**, a revolutionary VR illustration and animation tool. Working natively in VR allows us to craft hand-painted, immersive worlds with a distinctive artistic style that sets our work apart.

## My Role

As Creative Producer, I:
- Coordinate efforts between artists, developers, and stakeholders
- Foster a collaborative and innovative studio culture
- Manage production timelines and deliverables
- Guide creative direction while maintaining technical feasibility
- Build and maintain relationships with platform partners like Meta/Oculus

## The Journey

Studio Syro began with a music video project that brought together talented VR artists who had never worked together before. This collaboration proved so successful that it evolved into a full studio, eventually catching the attention of Oculus, who approached us to create a series for their Quest platform.

Over three years, we've grown from a small team working on a single music video to a recognized studio in the VR animation space, with our work featured at prestigious festivals and conferences worldwide.
