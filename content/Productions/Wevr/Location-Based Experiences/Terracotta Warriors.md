## My Role: Line Producer

As **Line Producer** on this ambitious project, I coordinated production teams across six international locations to deliver this historically accurate, large-scale immersive experience.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Multi-Location Coordination**: Managed teams in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Malta, UK, Taipei, and Xi'an
- **Production Pipeline Management**: Oversaw workflows between multiple development teams working across different time zones
- **Cross-Cultural Collaboration**: Facilitated communication between teams speaking different languages and working within different cultural contexts
- **Technical Coordination**: Ensured seamless integration of assets and systems from distributed teams
- **Schedule & Budget Management**: Kept the complex international production on track and within scope

### Production Challenges

- Coordinating real-time collaboration across 6 cities and multiple time zones
- Managing cultural nuances and language barriers between international teams
- Ensuring historical accuracy while maintaining compelling storytelling
- Integrating work from Atlanta-based interactive developer MotR (led by Jack Ehrbar and Andrew Weidenhammer)
- Delivering a theme park-quality experience on standalone mobile VR hardware

## The Experience

### Two-Act Journey

**Act I: Tomb Exploration Adventure**  
Visitors embark on an archaeological adventure complete with ancient traps, guided by a companion from the future. The experience allows exploration of previously unseen areas of the mausoleum.

**Act II: The Emperor's Legacy**
A magical transformation where archaeological artifacts come to life—terracotta warriors march in formation, and visitors witness the workshops where these eternal guardians were created.

### Technical Innovation

- **Massive Scale**: Three stages, each over 2,000 square feet
- **Synchronized Experience**: 150 people per hour flowing through shared virtual space
- **Real-Time Coordination**: 100+ headsets connected via WiFi in synchronized adventure
- **Historical Accuracy**: Every element rendered to historically accurate dimensions based on extensive research
- **Mobile VR**: Entire experience built in Unreal Engine running on standalone VIVE Focus Vision headsets

### Historical Significance

The Terracotta Army, discovered by local farmers in 1974, represents one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century. Over 8,000 unique warriors, each with individual facial features, have stood guard over Emperor Qin Shi Huang's final resting place for more than two millennia.

This VR experience offers something impossible in the physical world: the chance to step inside previously unseen areas and virtually witness the mausoleum as it was on the eve of the emperor's burial.
