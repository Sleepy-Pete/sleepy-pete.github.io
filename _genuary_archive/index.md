# Genuary 2026

Welcome to my Genuary 2026 collection! Genuary is a month-long creative coding challenge where artists create a new generative artwork each day based on daily prompts.

## What is Genuary?

Genuary is a generative art month - each day in January has a different prompt for creating code-based art. It's a great way to explore creative coding, try new techniques, and build a daily practice.

## My 2026 Entries

This folder contains my daily sketches for Genuary 2026, created with p5.js.
