# Portfolio Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is Peter Ariet's personal portfolio website built with Quartz (a static site generator for digital gardens). The site showcases work in immersive storytelling, VR production, and technical art.

## Content Structure
- **content/**: Markdown files for all pages
  - `about.md`: Main about page with bio, experience, skills, and recognitions
  - `index.md`: Homepage
  - `Productions/`: Studio Syro and WEVR project pages
  - `publications/`: Published work and articles
  - `Recognitions/`: Individual award and recognition pages

## Key Conventions

### Markdown Files
- Use clear, descriptive titles in frontmatter
- Include relevant tags for categorization
- Use wikilinks `[[path|text]]` for internal navigation
- Keep line length reasonable for readability

### Navigation
- Always include back links at the bottom of pages
- Use consistent link patterns: `[[about|← Back to About]]`
- Link to index and home pages for easy navigation

### Content Organization
- Group related content in subdirectories
- Create index.md files for directory landing pages
- Use hierarchical structure for complex topics

### Recognitions Section
- Each award gets its own dedicated page
- Pages organized by year (2025, 2024, 2023, etc.)
- Include context about the festival/award
- Link back to main Recognitions index
