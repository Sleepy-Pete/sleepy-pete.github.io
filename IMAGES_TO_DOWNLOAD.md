## How to Extract Images

Since the Squarespace website uses complex JavaScript to load images, you may need to:

1. **Manual Download**: Visit each episode page in a browser, right-click on images, and save them
2. **Browser DevTools**: Use browser developer tools to inspect image URLs in the Network tab
3. **Squarespace Image URLs**: Look for URLs matching pattern: `images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/67955b705a944f59c065f900/...`

## Next Steps

After downloading images:
1. Update markdown files to reference the correct image paths
2. Test that all images display correctly on the site
3. Optimize images for web if needed (compress, resize)
